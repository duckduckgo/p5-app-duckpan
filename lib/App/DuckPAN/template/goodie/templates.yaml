# Template definitions for goodies.

# A template set is a collection of templates used to generate all files of a
# sub-type of an Instant Answer type. Each set can have some 'required'
# templates (which are always applied) and some 'optional' templates (which are
# applied after asking the user).
# The 'subdir_support' field specifies if IAs created with the template set
# support being created inside a subdirectory. It defaults to 'true'.
