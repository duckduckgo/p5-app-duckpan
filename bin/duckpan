=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<DuckPAN|http://duckpan.org/> is a project of L<DuckDuckGo|https://duckduckgo.com/>
trying to make a release platform for the contributions to DuckDuckGo. DuckDuckGo
is a search engine, using so a so called Zero-click Info to spice the search result
with a very specific result, for example 2+2 or 200 USD to EUR. In this concept
there is like a nearly unlimited option of what contributions are possible. Beside
gathering those Zero-click Info plugins, we also want to use it to store all
released style projects of DuckDuckGo (for example opensource browser plugins and
the other user contributed tools).

We are still in the buildup of all this, but you may contact us in the channel
mentioned in the SUPPORT section down under. So anything can change, but we try to
keep this client and already implemented features stable.
