=head1 DuckPAN

The DuckDuckHack Testing Tool

=head2 SYNPOSIS

DuckPAN is an application built to provide developers a testing environment for DuckDuckHack Instant Answers. It allows you to test instant answer triggers and preview their visual design and output.

=head2 INSTALLATION

Please see L<https://github.com/duckduckgo/p5-app-duckpan#installing-duckpan> for all information regarding the installation of DuckPAN.

=head2 COMMANDS

B<duckpan check>:
    Checks if you fulfill all requirements for the development environment. This will run automatically during a B<duckpan release>.

B<duckpan query>:
    Test Goodie and Spice triggers interactively on the command line. For each query, the instant answers triggered will be displayed. This tool should be used to ensure your instant answer triggers correctly.

B<duckpan server>: [--verbose] [--no-cache] [--port <number>]
    Starts a local web server, which emulates the DuckDuckGo production environment. Allows for live testing of Goodie and Spice instant answers.  This tool should be used to ensure your instant answer displays correctly. For Spice instant answers, this is especially important to verify API calls are successful and no JavaScript errors exist.

    -v, --verbose:
        Provides more output from server

    --no-cache:
        Forces the cache to be repopulated each time the server starts (defaults to using cached copies of assets unless newer versions exist)

    -p, --port <number>:
        Forces DuckPAN server to run on the specified port (default port is 5000)

B<duckpan help>:
    Shows you the DuckPAN help page which briefly describes DuckPAN and its features.

B<duckpan test>:
    Tests your release, by running the tests in the B<t/> directory using Dzil (if a dist.ini exists) or prove. This will run automatically during a B<duckpan release>.

B<duckpan installdeps>:
  Attempt to install dependencies for the distribution in your current directory using cpanm.

B<duckpan roadrunner>:
  Same as installdeps, but without testing them. Meep meep!

    Upload a po file to the Community Platform. This is for Translation Managers only.

B<duckpan publisher>:
    Starts a local web server which displays static websites created with L<DuckDuckGo-Publisher|https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-publisher>.

B<duckpan release>:
    Pushes a new release of the current project (ie. Spice, Goodie or Publisher) to L<DuckPAN.org|http://duckpan.org>
